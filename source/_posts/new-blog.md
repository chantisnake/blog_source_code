This is the new blog that I am current using.
This blog will continue be focusing on the same content as my old blogs:
mainly about computer science, and technology.
also there will be some math involved, and last very little economics.

I have ditched the old blog and continue my life with this blog,
becuase the old ones is perticularly stupid...

For those who don't know,
I am currently a sophemore at Wheaton Collegen MA, majored in mathematics.
I started programming since I was 9, but still suck at it.
I love computer, but love math better.
I love open source, love Microsoft, hate Apple(this started when I was a little kid...)

That's about it... I will post more stuff on this blog if there is any.
Thanks guys.

this blog is still under development,
therefore there are some function that is not usable,
I will fix them soon.
